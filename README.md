# Predicting the Severity of Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Using Retinal Scans

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease associated with long-standing diabetes and currently a leading cause of vision loss within working-age adults. Early detection and treatment of this disease is crucial for improving patient outcomes. 

The DR_model.ipynb file includes the models used to explore the use of machine learning to predict the stage of diabetic retinopathy based on a fundus image of the retina. The file also includes instructions to load the dataset and running the models.
