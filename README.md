# Predicting the Severity of Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Using Retinal Scans

## Abstract

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease associated with long-standing diabetes and currently a leading cause of vision loss within working-age adults. Early detection and treatment of this disease is crucial for improving patient outcomes. 
In this paper, we explore several methods for predicting the severity of diabetic retinopathy from retinal scans using k-means clustering and deep learning. We evaluate our method on a dataset of retinal images and show that pretrained convolutional neural networks can predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy with reasonable accuracy. Our results suggest that our approach could be a useful tool for early detection and treatment of the disease.
